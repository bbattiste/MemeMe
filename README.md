# MemeMe

## Project Overview

Students have created an app that enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme, and share that meme on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email. In this project, sent memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.

## Why this project?

MemeMe covers many of the major UI components found in essentially every app. It combines them with the camera and social media activity view to create a fun and personal user experience.

## What Will I learn?

<ul>
<li>Set up a navigation structure that creates an intuitive flow through the app</li>
<li>Build tables with datasources and delegates</li>
<li>Create custom table view cells</li>
<li>Implement user interfaces with tab views and collection views</li>
</ul>

# Why is this project meaningful to my career?

<ul>
<li>Becoming comfortable using all of the key components of UIKit is an essential step in becoming an iOS developer.</li>
<li>Understanding UIKit allows a developer to make educated assumptions about the architecture of apps that they use.</li>
<li>Mastering UKit fundamentals frees a developer up to learn model-oriented skills like networking and persistence.</li>
</ul>
